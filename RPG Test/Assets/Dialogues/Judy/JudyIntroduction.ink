Here it is! my newborn star.
I don't know about the star part but I feel like a newborn right now.
HAHA I like your sense of humor, how are you felling?
I'm recovering fast but I can't remember anything from last night.
What a perfect coincidence don't you think? losing our memories sometimes can be a blessing.
Well.. more than a blessing I feel like someone cursed me right now.
That is truly interesting, anything else you feel?
I was joking, curses doesn't exist.
Oh darling you will be surprised.
Sure... I don't know your name yet.
I'm Judy, writer and founder of this little town.
You are in charge here then?
Not entirely, Sofia is the leader here go talk with her she is waiting for you.
